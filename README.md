# QGIS_Plugin

As part of the Python in GIS course given at IFGI, we created a plugin for removing empty fields in a vector in QGIS. 
This repository includes the files to create a field_remover plugin. The main code is written in **field_remover.py**.

### This plugin was build using:
* QGIS Plugin BuilderPlugin (creates all input files automatically) 
* QGIS plugin reloaderplugin 
* Qt Creator/Designer (GUI)
* PyUIC5 (.ui to .py)
* PyRCC5 (.qrc to .py)


#### References:
* The steps and instructions to build this plugin were given as a part of the course **Python in GIS** given at the Institue for Geoinformatics, The University of Muenster (WWU) 
* [PyQGIS Developer Cookbook - Developing Python Plugins](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins/index.html)
